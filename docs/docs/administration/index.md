# Administration

In Pimcore there are two levels of user permissions. Firstly, the permissions on system components and secondly permissions on data elements (assets, objects and documents). Permissions can be granted to roles or individual users. The following paragraphs describe how and where permissions can be set and how they will or will not affect each other.

It is not mandatory to use roles, permissions can be granted to users directly. However, it is advised to use roles if there is a larger user group to manage. In the user/role settings tab it can be decided which permissions are granted to that user or role. An individual user has a few more general settings than the role.
