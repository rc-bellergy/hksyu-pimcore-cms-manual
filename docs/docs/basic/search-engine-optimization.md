At the top of this tab is the "Title & Description" section. Title and description must always be filled in, whereby HTML tags are to be regarded as optional. The title describes the page in one or a few words and the description summarizes the content of the page briefly and concisely. The title should not exceed a character length of 60 characters and the character length of the description should not pass the mark 170.

## Pretty URL

The Pretty URL setting overrides a document's full path only for the purpose of routing. This is useful for when you would like to create shorter paths or friendly URLs for sharing. A Pretty URL does not redirect to the original URL.

Here is example.  
Original URL: https://demo.com/about/our-story/aticle/123

Fill the "our-story-123" in pretty url field.

Pretty URL: https://demo.com/our-story-123

The editor can set it in the same places of the above instruction.
