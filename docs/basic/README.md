## The Basic

Pimcore divides the contents to be managed into 3 major sections: [**Documents**](documents/), [**Assets**](assets/) and [**Data Objects**](data-objects/).

| Subjects                      | Descriptions                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [Documents](documents/)       | Use documents to manage the web pages and the navigation menus                 |
| [Assets](assets/)             | Use assets to manage the images, downloadable files (e.g. PDF, ZIP files etcs) |
| [Data Objects](data-objects/) | Use data object to manage the structured data (e.g. news, events, staffs etc.) |

In addition to the above three major sections, here are some additional features to help you manage your website more conveniently.
